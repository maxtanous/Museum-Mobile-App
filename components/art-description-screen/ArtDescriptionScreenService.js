His body is angled towards the top right corner of the canvas.He is looking up at an angel in the top right corner. He is reaching his left arm towards an angel. The angel is located in the upper right side of the canvas at approximately 2 o’clock.She is looking down at Saint Peter and holding his left arm with her right hand. There is a chain in the bottom right corner of the painting. Saint Peter’s feet have been released from the chain by the angel. Most of the painting is in shadow except for the angel who has light shining from behind her.',
        thematic: 'The painting portrays the story told in the Bible in Acts of the Apostles about Saint Peter’s imprisonment by King Herod. Herod persecuted the leadership of the growing Christian Church. The night before Peter’s prosecution, an angel appeared and woke him, removing the chains from his hands. The angel in the painting is standing over Peter in a white dress. She has red hair and faint wings shadowed behind her shoulders. The angel has a red fabric shawl draped over her right arm and across her body, holding the rest of the fabric in her left hand. Her right hand holds Saint Peter’s left hand representing the moment of the angel freeing Peter from the chains. Peter is wearing a blue tunic and his legs are partially covered by a gold fabric shawl. His left hand reaches up to the angel and his face appears desperate as he waits for her to free him. Peter’s right hand is at 8 o’clock and holding a set of keys. The keys symbolize Saint Peter’s ability to bind or loosen souls who were waiting to receive their judgement to possibly enter the kingdom of heaven.'
